# Hosting Maven Repos on Github


1. Set up/identify your Maven repo project on Github

	You need to figure out where you’re going to deploy (and then host) your project artifacts.  I’ve created a new 		repo, and checked it out at the root of my dev directory.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/hukuuu/maven-artifacts.git maven-artifacts
	```

	Because Maven namespaces artifacts based on their group and artifact IDs, you should probably have only one 			Github-hosted Maven repository for all of your projects and other miscellaneous artifact storage.  I can’t 	see any reason 	to have a repository-per-project.

2. Set up separate snapshots and releases directories.

	```
	mkdir snapshots
	mkdir releases
   	```
    
3. Deploy your project’s artifacts to your Maven repo
    
	A properly-useful pom.xml contains a <distributionManagement> configuration that specifies the repositories to 			which     one’s project artifacts should be deployed.  If you’re only going to use Github-hosted Maven 			repositories, then we       just need to stub this configuration out (doing this will not be necessary in 		the future1):

	```
    	<distributionManagement>
    		<repository>
    			<id>repo</id>
    			<url>https://github.com/hukuuu/maven-artifacts/tree/master/releases</url>
    		</repository>
    		<snapshotRepository>
    			<id>snapshot-repo</id>
    			<url>https://github.com/hukuuu/maven-artifacts/tree/master/snapshots</url>
    		</snapshotRepository>
    	</distributionManagement>
	```

    	Now let’s run the clutch build and deploy our artifacts (which handily implies running all of the project’s 			tests),      providing a path to our repo’s clone directory using the altDeploymentRepository system 			property:

    	```  
	mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=snapshot-repo::default::file:../../cemerick-mvn-repo/snapshots clean deploy
    	```


4. Push to Github

5. Use your new Maven repository

    	add this to the depending project:

	```
	<repositories>
    	<repository>
        	<id>cemerick-snapshots</id>
        	<url>https://github.com/cemerick/cemerick-mvn-repo/raw/master/snapshots</url>
    	</repository>
	</repositories>
    	```
